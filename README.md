# New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe Bingo Board Generator

Using this program, you will be able to generate a text file that contains a JSON format of random levels in NSMBUDX/NSLUDX/NSMBU/NSLU that you can copy/paste into a custom bingo board on Bingosync.


### Downloading the Project

1. Download the ZIP folder and extract the folder to your computer. *Make sure that you remember the exact file path that points to the unzipped folder!*

2. Open Windows PowerShell (or terminal on MacOS or Linux) and type cd followed by the file path from Step 1. For example, if you are a Windows user and you save the program to your Desktop, then type:

```
cd 'Desktop\NSMBUDX IL Bingo Board Generator'
```

3. Type the following into your terminal/command prompt:

```
make java
```

4. Follow the instructions of the program to build either an IL bingo card or a normal bingo card
5. Open BINGOCARD.txt and copy the contents of the file
6. Paste the contents into the custom bingo board area at Bingosync
7. Create the card and play.



### How to Play IL Bingo

The goal is to complete a row/column/diagonal as fast as possible. In order to mark a square on the board, you must either **tie** or **beat** the world record for that run based on the leaderboards at speedrun.com. The game ends once a row/column/diagonal is complete. Timing starts on first input from the starting point in W1 and timing ends when a bingo is obtained.

It is recommended to play on a 100% file so that you have access to all levels. Also IL rules apply, meaning you can use whatever powerups you want minus P-Acorns and Stars. Going to Toad Houses during the game or complete other levels to obtain certain powerups during the game is allowed.



### How to Play Normal Bingo

Like IL Bingo, the goal is to complete a row/column/diagonal as fast as possible. However, the goals in this mode are similar to goals you would find in a typical speedrunning bingo game. Timing starts on pressing "OK" from a **NEW FILE** and ends when a bingo is completed. Any% Normal rules apply for bingo, which means that switching characters (if possible for your game) is allowed. 



### Other Bingo Twists

There are many different ways that you can play bingo apart from just single bingo. Some other game mode options are listed below:



* **Double Bingo:** First to complete two bingos wins
* **Triple Bingo:** First to complete three bingos win
* **Anti-Bingo:** Players pick bingos for each other. Decisions must be made before the end of the opening cutscene. Alternatively, you can make the decisions prior to starting the race (in which case you can start from a zero file if interested). First runner to complete their bingo wins
* **Double Anti-Bingo:** Opponent picks a bingo for you to complete, then you get to choose your second bingo to complete. First person to finish two bingos wins
* **Lockout Bingo:** When a player marks a goal, no other player in the game can mark that same goal. Whoever completes the most goals after the card is filled wins
  * Alternatively, you can play until someone has cleared 13 goals because at that point it is impossible for the other player to win
* **X Goal Bingo:** First person to complete any X Goals on the card wins
* **X Goal Lockout Bingo:** First to complete any X Goals on the card with lockout rules wins
