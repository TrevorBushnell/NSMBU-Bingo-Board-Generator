# New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe IL Bingo Board Generator

Using this program, you will be able to generate a text file that contains a JSON format of random levels in NSMBUDX (or NSLUDX; or even their OG counterparts) that you can copy/paste into a custom bingo board on Bingosync.


### Downloading the Project

1. Download the ZIP folder and extract the folder to your computer. *Make sure that you remember the exact file path that points to the unzipped folder!*

2. Open your command prompt (or terminal on MacOS or Linux) and type cd followed by the file path from Step 1. For example, if you are a Windows user and you save the program to your Desktop, then type:

```
cd 'Desktop\NSMBUDX IL Bingo Board Generator'
```

3. Type the following into your terminal/command prompt:

```
NSMBUDX_Bingo_Board_Generator.exe NSMBUDXLevels.txt BingoBoard.txt
```

NOTE: You can make the final argument (BingoBoard.txt) whatever you want, just make sure that the file extension is .txt

4. Open BingoBoard.txt (or whatever you named the file) and copy the contents of the file

5. Paste the contents into the custom bingo board area at Bingosync

6. Create the card and play.



### How to Play Bingo

The goal is to complete a row/column/diagonal as fast as possible. In order to mark a square on the board, you must either **tie** or **beat** the world record for that run based on the leaderboards at speedrun.com. The game ends once a row/column/diagonal is complete.

It is recommended to play on a 100% file so that you have access to all levels. Also IL rules apply, meaning you can use whatever powerups you want. You can also go to Toad Houses during the game or complete other levels to obtain certain powerups.
